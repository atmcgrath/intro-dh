## Digital Publishing Best Practices

### General considerations

- **Copyright**​
  -  Do not publish copyrighted material: always find licensing information for images and media you use and make sure you have permission. 
- **Accessibility**​
  - Use alternative text, high-contrast font colors, and heading/list structures to make your content accessible to users with disabilities. The [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) is a great resource for testing.
- **Privacy & Permission**​
  - Never publish a person’s photo, name, or any personal information without their consent. Make sure all collaborators are represented the way they wish.​
- **Credit & Attribution**​
  - Always credit the source of media and data that you use, including museums and libraries holding primary source material, and individual creators if relevant. 
  - Include metadata, links, and a bibliography/works cited page if relevant.
- **Design & Style**​ 
  - Think about your audience: try to make the presentation eye-catching and easy to understand. 
  - Information should be organized in a logical manner.​
- **Reviewing**
  - ​Test your site on different browsers and devices.
  - Have someone else view and interact with your content if possible and build in time to fix any issues.​
- **Writing**
  - Remember that you are writing for an audience. What context do they need to understand your work? What can you do to make their experience as seamless as possible?


### Using media

- Always be careful about whose content you put on website: only use resources you have the right to use.​
- Look for material in the public domain or using a Creative Commons license that enables reuse. ​
- Assume images are in copyright unless they say otherwise
- Cite your media! Include attribution of the photographer, the source, and the license information​.

### Finding rights-free media

- [Wikimedia Commons]([Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)): user-contributed media without known copyright
- [Creative Commons search](): you can search by license type
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/): professional quality stock photo repositories, free to use with attribution
- Museum and library collections: institutions such as Library of Congress, The Met, The Getty, and more have resources in the public domain

### Metadata

"Metadata is a love note to the future" (Rachel Lovinger, ["Metadata is a love note to the future"](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/metadata-is-a-love-note-to-the-future/48531570), 2015)

- Creator/author: person(s) who created the work -- photographers, writers, artists, directors, etc.
- Date: when it was created (even approximate)
- Title: what is it called (even if it's long)
- Format: book? jpeg? Painting?
- Rights information/license: is it in copyright? Is it public domain? Creative Commons? Fair use? What legal terms govern its use on your site and elsewhere?
- Source: where did you get it and/or where is it found - museum/archive? Collection? Wikimedia? 
  - Include multiple if relevant (ie Amsterdam Museum of Art via Wikimedia Commons)
    - Link to item record if possible
- Identifier: 
  - DOI, call number, accession number: any unique string that distinguishes it
