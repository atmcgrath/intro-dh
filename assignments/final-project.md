### Rubric

- **Execution**: does the work follow assignment instructions and include all required features? Are tools used effectively, demonstrating skills built during this class?
- **Visual and written communication**: does the project communicate effectively to a general audience? Do design choices serve the content and purpose of the site? Does the project follow best practices for style, accessibility?
- **Insight**: does the approach demonstrate analysis, creativity, and insight into materials? Are the methods explained sufficiently?
- **Research**: does the project engage effectively with its primary and secondary sources? Does media include appropriate credits and metadata? Does the project's bibliography follow citation guidelines?
