## Data Essay assignment instructions

The goal of this assignment is to explore a dataset through a combination of data visualization and text. Your essay should be live on the web and designed and written for a non-specialized public audience. You may select your dataset, tools, and visualization types. You will [submit the link to Moodle](https://moodle.brynmawr.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=371805) by Friday, March 28.

Your project should include:

- A bibliography with the data's source and any secondary sources consulted. Citations should be detailed and consistent (i.e. Chicago, MLA, APA...) and should include hyperlinks.
- A title for your essay (and for any individual visualizations if relevant)
- One or more visualizations embedded as still images or interactive objects, with labels and keys.
- Approximately 300-500 words of text

Your essay should include:

- A narrative about this data: an interpretation of what the visualization(s) might show or suggest.
- An explanation (in your own words) of the dataset itself and how it was collected, along with any context you think is relevant for interpretation.
- An explanation of your choices in selecting tools, visualizations, a any additional cleaning work you performed.
- A description of any relevant limitations of the dataset, or the unanswered questions it raises.

### Data options

You may choose any dataset, as long as it is well documented and you are able to glean sufficient context to inform your analysis. I recommend looking at the datasets featured in the [ Data is Plural podcast](https://podcast.data-is-plural.com/2159594/episodes) or  [Responsible Datasets in Context](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/), or in the *[Introduction to Cultural Analytics in Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)* textbook.
