# Project Review

For this assignment, you will carefully review and analyze a digital humanities project in order to understand how it was created. 

## Instructions

Select a Digital Humanities project from the list below and study it carefully. 
Try to answer the following questions, using the framework laid out in the "How they built this" video:

- Sources: identify the sources used in this project.
	- What primary sources were included or consulted?
	- What secondary sources were included or consulted?
	- Why were those sources selected?
- Processing: describe how the project team conducted their research.
	- What methods did they use to document, digitize, extract data from, or analyze their sources?
	- What tools and strategies played a crucial role in processing the material?
- Presentation: how is their work presented and why is it presented that way?
	- What tools, platforms, or modalities are they using to present their research?
	- What significant design choices have they made?
- Reflections: what is your impression of the overall project? 
	- What is the effect of the decisions that were made at each layer?
	- What opportunities for expansion, revision, or continuation can you imagine?

Write an essay of 500-750 words describing the project. Make sure you address the project's sources, processing, and presentation, as well as including your own thoughts and reflections.

- Optional questions:
	- What methodological and theoretical frameworks did the authors use to conduct their work?
