## Visual Essay Assignment Instructions

The goal of this assignment is to build an interactive mini-exhibit or visual essay that includes primary source material and commentary on that material. I encourage you to select a topic related to your final project, if relevant. You may choose to tell a story about your topic that is illustrated with media, analyze and comment on the media items individually, or analyze and comment on the items as a collection.

Your project should be live on the web and it should include:
- A title
- 4-6 visual/media resources with metadata and citation information
- A bibliography with detailed citations
- Text of 300-500 words 

Deadline: April ~~14~~18 on Moodle ([assignment submission link](https://moodle.brynmawr.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=374410))
