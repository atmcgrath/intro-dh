"Digital Humanities" includes a variety of ways that computers can be used to explore, analyze, and publish human histories and cultural objects (literature, art, music, and more), as well as the study of computer technologies through humanistic frameworks. This course will provide a general introduction to digital humanities through a combination of reading, discussion, and hands-on digital making. We will seek to understand and critically assess digital infrastructures, how culture are represented and analyzed computationally, and the limits and possibilities of data-centric approaches for humanities scholarship.
