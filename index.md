## About

This course provides a general introduction to digital humanities through a combination of reading, discussion, and hands-on digital making. "Digital Humanities" describes a range of ways that computers are used to explore, analyze, and publish human histories and cultural objects (literature, art, music, and more), as well as the study of digital technologies through humanistic frameworks. We will seek to understand and critically assess digital infrastructures, how culture are represented and analyzed computationally, and the limits and possibilities of data-centric approaches for humanities scholarship, while building core digital competencies.
