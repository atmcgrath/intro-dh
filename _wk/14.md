For this week's response, I'd like you to read over your previous posts and reflect on the work we've done together in this class. A few questions to consider:

- What themes, concepts, and ideas stand out to you as most important?
- How has your thinking about digital humanities methods changed over time?
- What activities, readings, or assignments did you find most interesting and helpful for your understanding and engagement with digital humanities?
- What skills or areas of knowledge have you learned that will carry forward beyond this semester?
