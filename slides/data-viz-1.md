# Readings & discussion

# [Data X Design](https://dataxdesign.io/chapters/intro)

![Two nineteenth-century data visualizations](media/playfair-shanawdithit.png)

<small>Visualzations by [William Playfair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Playfair) (left) and [Shanawdithit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanawdithit) (right), from Data x Design, Introduction</small>


## "Introduction: A Counterhistory of Data Visulization"

- What is important about the visual & digital form of this chapter?
- Why does it matter which examples we use to tell the history of data visualization?


# Data Humanism

Giorgia Lupi: ["The Revolution will be Visualized"](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold)

![Data Humanism](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/550de105e4b05c49fa2bba03/1532010285164-6Y4L8YI7NCD15NDX54IS/datahumanism.jpeg?format=2500w)

[Data Humanism, a visual manifesto](https://giorgialupi.com/data-humanism-my-manifesto-for-a-new-data-wold), by Giorgia Lupi


## What makes data "human"?

What about "humanistic"?
