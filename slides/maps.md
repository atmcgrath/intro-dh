# Mapping Workshop

Thursday, March 21

## Styling map data

1. Log in to ArcGIS Online
  - Bryn Mawr: login with SSO at [brynmawrcollege.maps.arcgis.com](https://brynmawrcollege.maps.arcgis.com)
  - Haverford: login with SSO at [trico.maps.arcgis.com](https://trico.maps.arcgis.com)

2. Start with [Cartographic creations - Style and thematic data](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/cartographic-creations-style-thematic-data/)

## Chose-your-own adventure

Continue working at your own pace with one of these options:

- Continue the [Cartographic creations](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/paths/cartographic-creations-with-web-maps/) tutorial series with [Make pop-ups and labels](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/cartographic-creations-make-pop-ups-and-labels/)

- Try working on a different dataset and following some of the steps from the 'Style and thematic data' section. For example, try using this [Philadelphia City Landmarks dataset](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/city-landmarks/) from [Open Data Philly](https://opendataphilly.org/).

- Follow a different tutorial, such as this project based tutorial for data summaries: [Summarize cycling routes within townships](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/summarize-cycling-routes-within-townships/) Or this deep dive into [Chloropleth maps](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/paths/design-choropleth-maps/)

- Challenge: can you find geographic data for the [U.S. National Park visitors dataset](https://www.responsible-datasets-in-context.com/posts/np-data/?tab=explore-the-data)? What steps would you need to take to map this dataset?

### Embedding your map
- Data essay sample repository: [Data essay live site](https://hist105b.github.io/data-essay/) and [data essay repository](https://github.com/hist105b/data-essay)
- Make sure your layers and map are shared publicly (you can manage this on the "content" tab in ArcGIS online)
- Get the embed code:
  - From the map viewer, the left hand menu has an elipses -> Embed
  - You can select options for the embed and it will generate an iframe for you.
  - Copy and paste that into a website
- Or [create an iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp): add the url as a 'src' element and specify the width and height
