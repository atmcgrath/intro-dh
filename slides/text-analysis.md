## Project ideation

<section>

On your paper, write your name. Start brainstorming:

1. A skill you want to learn or practice (i.e. work with data, functional programming, design, web development)
2. A thing you want to make or emulate (a website, visualization, or other genre)
3. A primary source, archive, or dataset you want to explore or highlight
4. A research question or topic you'd like to learn more about
5. An assignment from another class that you could reimagine in digital project form

</section>

Flip over the paper. Combine 2 or more of your answers into a project idea "mashup". Try to think of 2 or 3 options.
