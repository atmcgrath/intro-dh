### Vocabulary/concepts

- **Mesh**: a 3d structure composed of vertices, edges, and polygons/faces
- **UV Mapping**: projecting a 2D image onto the model
- **Textures** or materials: surface properties of a 3D models, usually consisting of an image and reflectance properties
- **Rendering**: viewing a model with light and materials

### 3D methods and modes

### Techniques for capturing 3D imagery

- Photogrammetry 
  - Multiple photographs from various angles are extrapolated into a 3D model
  - Specialized software identifies common points to reconstruct geometry
- 3D Scanning (specialized equipment)
  - Structured Light Scanning: projects patterned light to capture the stretch of the pattern
  - Laser Scanning: lasers measure distance to surface of the object at various points

### Tools

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/): open-source 3D modeling and animation application:
  - Used for "Flow" (Gints Zilbalodis, 2024) - [view Flow trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5zSgSuIDU4&list=PLvJeTmFXYsRYLzw-j8PpoDScVWL6ldUE4&index=1)
- [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/en) - 3D CAD tool, easier to learn, used by architects/space designers
- [Polycam](https://poly.cam/) - freemium app for photogrammetry using smartphones
- [Agisoft](https://www.agisoft.com/) - advanced photogrammetry software available in DMCL
- [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) - 3D modeling tool used to prepare meshes for printing
- [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) - open-source tool for processing and editing 3d mesh models



### Polycam

1. In pairs: have one person go to [poly.cam](https://poly.cam/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Download smartphone app
3. Select an object to scan
4. On a neutral background, photograph it from all angles (about 100 photos)
